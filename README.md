# Tribute page

This is my second trial project with **Microverse**. It is a product landing web page built with **HTML** & **CSS** through **pair programming**.
The project required several instructions to be followed in building HTML tags.
The instructions included a special request, where it is required to have a **responsive layout** and use **CSS flexbox** features.
